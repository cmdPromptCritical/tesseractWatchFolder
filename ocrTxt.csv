Abstract

Oxidation of UO2 exposed to steamcan resultin
enhanced release of fission products from within the fuel
grains. Several different approaches have been used to
model the releases.

In this paper, two approaches to modelling
fission product release under steam oxidizing conditions
are described and compared. They are:

Enhanced grain growth accompanied by grain
boundary sweeping, and

Enhanced vacancy production leading to increase
in the diffusion coefficient of. ‘fission gases in UO2.

Two different models which use the first -

approachare included in this paper along with one which
uses the second approach. The results of the comparison
are that the enhanced vacancy production model predicts
higher releases than the enhanced grain growth models

over relatively long periods of time. For short time spans, -

the models yield similar predictions.

L Introduction —

In some postulated accident scenarios, fuel
element failure can result in exposure of the UO) fuel
pellets to steam for a significant period of time. Fuel
which is exposed to steam can chemically react with it to
form a higher oxide (i.e. UO2, where x is the deviation
from stoichiometry). Oxidation can. cause enhanced
fission product release from the fuel In safety analysis,
estimates of the quantity and timing of fission preduct
releases from failed fuel elements are required in order to
ultimately assess the potential impact of the accident on
the public. Hence it is important to develop our
understanding of the releases of fission products under
steam oxidizing conditions.

Fission gas adatoms which are produced during
uradiation of UO fuel can migrate through the matrix to

grain boundaries, from where they may be released, Gas
atom movement may be controlled by either thermal (e.g.
diffusion) or athermal (e.g. due to irradiation) processes.

Fission products are assumed to be transported
from UO) fuel grains to the grain boundaries by diffusion
and by grain growth accompanied by
sweeping/coliecting of fission products as the grain
boundary moves [1].

An important mechanism governing the release
of fission products at high temperatures is the ‘intrinsic’
(or classical) diffusion of gas atoms to grain boundaries,
followed by the growth of channels leading to open

. surfaces. However, at low temperatures, the observed

releases cannot be explained by an extrapolation of the
classical diffusion theory. Therefore, the releases at low
temperatures are assumed to occur via irradiation
enhanced athermal diffusion [2]. Furthermore, defects
and vacancies within the UO2 can influence the mobility
of gas atoms. For example, it is argued that as it moves
through the lattice, a fission gas atom has a probability of
capture and of escape from internal trapping sites (e.g.
point defects, fission gas bubbles) [3}. The effects of
these mechanisms are generally combined in an
empirical ‘effective’ diffusion coefficient [2,3].

Grain boundary sweeping occurs when bubbles
containing fission gas and the grain boundaries on which
they are located migrate due to grain growth, sweeping
gas from the grains [4]. The “swept” gas is collected.on
the grain boundary where it is available for subsequent
release to void. ,

An increase in the fuel oxygen to uranium (O/U)
ratio leads to a direct enhancement of the release of
fission products from the fuel matrix. In this paper,
differert models which have been constructed to account
for the effect of oxidation on fission product release are
described and compared. The models are divided into two
categories. The first category is comprised of two
methods which model the enhanced release in steam asbasher/aboud

resulting from an increase in the grain growth rate
accompanied by prain boundary sweeping. The second is
a simplified version of a recent model due to Lewis et al
[5] which assumes that the releases result from an
increase in the concentration of vacancies in oxidized
UO2+x. The resulting enhancement of the diffusion
coefficient is then used to estimate the releases.

2. Oxidation

There is a substantial amount of literature
covering the subject of steam oxidation of UO2. The
understanding of important processes involved in the
oxidation reaction and in the observed enhanced release
of fission products has evolved. considerably over the
years.

In 1968, Bittel et al [6] reported that steam
oxidation was controlled by diffusion of oxygen through
the UO, matrix, as opposed to being controlled by the
reaction at the surface of the fuel. Bittel etal also reported
accelerated grain growth for UO2 exposed to steam.

However, in 1970, Carter and Lay [7]
investigated the subject of the rate-limiting process for
oxidation in a CO2/CO atmosphere. They concluded,
based on the absence of a measurable oxygen gradient in
their samples, that oxidation is controlled by the reaction
at the solid/gas interface. No concentration gradient
means that oxygen diffusion within the specimen is faster
than oxygen transfer across the exposed surface.
Therefore, the degree of oxidation is limited by the
reaction at the interface. -

Carter also found that oxidation rates were
proportional to the ratio of surface area/volume and to the
COz+CO partial pressure in a CO)+COtinert gas
atmosphere. An expression for the oxidation rate was
developed based on these results:
dx/dt = a [xe — x()] (S/V) qd)
where:

a is the surface exchange coefficient of oxygen,
X- is the equilibrium deviation from stoichiometry,
x(t) is the deviation from stoichiometry at time t,
S/V is the surface to volume ratio.

Assuming that the fuel is initially
stoichiometric (x(0) = 0), then the solution of the above
differential equation is:

x() =x, [ 1] —exp CaSyV) J (2)

The equilibrium deviation from stoichiometry
is defined by the oxygen potential of the gas phase. The

iderra

Papersiox:
199t/June/10

oxygen potenual in tum is a function of the oxygen partial
pressure in the steam. A method for determining x, is
described in reference [5]. x. may be interpreted as the
thermodynamic limit of fuel oxidation during exposure Lo
steam [8].

The surface exchange coefficient has been
determined experimentally by Cox et al [9] in the
temperature range 1000-1600° C. Comparison with data
from previous experiments suggest that the expression
can be extrapolated to both higher and lower
temperatures. The surface exchangecoefficient, a, can be
calculated from the following correlation:

a = 36.5 exp (-23500/T) (cm/sec) @)
where T is the temperature in K.

Cox and others have also reported that UO2
oxidation in steam leads to an increase in the rate of grain
growth compared to that observed in an_ inert
environment [6,9,10]. It is argued that the activation
energy of grain growth is influenced by the e presence of
excess oxygen [1].

3. Enhanced Grain Growth Model

The phenomenon of enhanced grain growth in
steam has been used to model the enhancement of fission
product releases when UOz is exposed to steam [e.g.
1,11].

Two models of grain growth are described in
this paper. Both are modifications of the same equation
for grain growth in an inert atmosphere. The equation is
based on in-reactor and laboratory measurements of
grain size in UO2 samples [1]:

d25 — do?5 = 2.22x10° At exp(—39200/T) (4)

where
d= final grain diameter (j1m)
do = initial grain diameter (1m)
T = temperature (K)
At = time interval (seconds)

The first model (Model A) is from a paper by
Lau and Rance [1] and is based on the experiments of
Belle and Lustman [10]. The modified grain growth
equation is:

d*5 — do@5 = 1.99 At exp(-10070/T)
for T < 1800° C (5)

d2-5 — do25 = 2.22x108 At exp(-39200/T)
for T > 1800°C (6)The second model (Model B) is based on the
same experimental data as Model A, but follows a more
conservative approach. Belle and Lustman [10] reported
that the resultant grain size obtained by heating UO? at
1700° C in inert aumosphere is the same as that obtained
by heating in steam at 1400° C for identical heating
period. Thus, the model assumes that grain growth in
steam obeys the same rate law as in inert gas except that
the temperature dependence is conservatively shifted by
400 degrees. For this model, the grain growth is derived
from the following equation:

d25 — dp?-5 = 2.22x10° At exp(-39200/(T+400)) (7)

The two grain growth models are compared in
figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the parameter
(d*5—dg?)/At versus inverse temperature for both
models as well as for grain growth in an inert
environment. The grain size predicted with Model B is
greater than that predicted with Model A over the range
of temperatures displayed (1400 to 2400° C). Figure 2
shows the grain growth over 1 hour at 2400° C and at
1800° C. Model B predicts faster grain growth than
Model A. -

For both models, grain boundary sweeping is
assumed to be responsible for the increased fractional
release. In calculating the fission product release due to
grain boundary sweeping, it is assumed that the grain
boundaries are satmrated. Therefore any fission gas
amriving on the grain boundary is assumed to be
immediately released. This assumption is generally good
for high burnup fuel [1]. It is further assumed that grain
growth is equiaxed as opposed to columnar. Both growth
processes are known to occur, however equiaxed growth
dominates when temperatures are lower than about 2100°
C and large temperature gradients are not present in the

UO,

By making these assumptions, a simple
expression for the fraction of fission gas released as a
function of the increase in grain size is obtained:

f = 1—do3/(dy + Ad)? (8)

where:
Ad is the increase in grain size due to equiaxed grain
growth (jum).

4, Enhanced Vacancy Production Model

basher/aboud

. When uranium dioxide becomes oxidized, the
excess Oxygen is incorporated within the existing lattice
as interstitials, resultifg in a reduction in the number of

oxygen vacancies. There is a corresponding increase in

papersioxide/ra
1991/June/10

the number of uranium vacancies. Lidiard {12] gives an
equation to estimate the fraction of uranium vacancies as
a function of the deviation from stoichiometric
composition (x in UO2,,x). Lidiard’s equation is used to
model the enhancement of the diffusion coefficient due
to oxidation.

4.1 Diffusion Coefficient

In order to account for the excess of uranium
vacancies in the calculation of fission product releases, it
is necessary to model the influence of these vacancies on
the diffusion of atoms through the grains.

A recent interpretation of fission product
diffusion mechanisms by Killeen and Turnbull [2]
separates the diffusion process into three components,
each of which is dominant in a different temperature
regime:

i. intrinsic diffusion at high temperatures (Dj),

_ ii. irradiation enhanced vacancy production at

intermediate temperatures (Dj;) and,

iii, irradiation enhanced athermal diffusion at low
temperatures (Djii).

whereS = exp (-147200/RT) (16)
Fo = exp(-71300/RT) (17)

The model proposed by Lewis et al [5] uses the
diffusion coefficient described above to modify the
empirical one in the ANS 5.4 [13] model employed in
CANDU fuel codes such as ELESIM [14]. Thus the ANS
5.4 diffusion coefficient is multiplied by a correction
factor H(x) to account for deviation from stoichiometry.

If Ds.4is the diffusion coefficient in the ANS 5.4
model, then

D’5.4=Ds.4- H(x) (18)
where
H(x) = D(x,T) / D(x=0,T) (19)

The fractional releases are calculated using the
Booth model [15] which gives the cumulative release
from the grains f:

f=6-(D’s,4 t/ra2)¥/2 — 3 D’s.4 t/a? (20)

where
D’s.4= modified diffusion coefficient (m2/sec)
t= time (sec)
a= grain radius (m)

This method of calculating the fission product
release is a simplification of the model described in
reference 5, where the enhanced diffusion coefficient was
incorporated into the ELESIM fuel code.

As in models A and B, it is assumed that the
grain boundaries are saturated, and that any fission gas
arriving on the grain boundary is immediately released.

42 Deviation from Stoichiometry

In order to use this model, it is necessary to
estimate the deviation from stoichiometry of the uranium
dioxide which is exposed to steam (x in UO»,,). The
method used is the one reported in section 2. The results
are shown in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the variation

~ of the degree of oxidation with time for various

‘

ashertaboud

temperatures. The oxidation rate is much more rapid as
the temperature increases. Figure 4 shows the correction
factor (H(x) calculated using equation 19) as a function

‘«» O£x for temperatures ranging from 700 to 2200° C. Little

enhancement is predicted at low temperatures (700 to
1000° C) unless the fuel reaches a state of oxidation
around UO z;. However at higher temperatures, the
correction factor can-be 1000 or greater. The factor is
highest around 1400°C.

5. Comparison =

A comparison of the fission product releases
predicted by each model is shown in figures 5, 6 and 7.
The models are designated as follows:

Model A: Enhanced grain growth model suggested by
Lau & Rance (see section 3)

Model B: Enhanced grain growth modelled by 400°
temperature shift (see section 3)

Model C: Enhanced vacancy production model
suggested by Lewis et al (see section 4)

In all the simulations, the initial grain size (‘do’
in equations 4-8; ‘2a’ in equation 20) was chosen to be
7.5 yum. The UQ) surface to volume ratio, which is used
in the calculation of the deviation from stoichiometry
(equations 1 and 2) was determined assuming a stack with
diameter 1.2 cm. and length SO cm. (roughly the
dimensions of the fuel within a CANDU fuel element).
The resulting value for S/V is 3.37 cml.

The releases plotted in figures 5, 6 and 7 were
calculated differently for Models A & B than for Model
C. Total releases predicted by model C are calculated with
equation 20 using the enhanced diffusion coefficient
(equation 18) which accounts for both ‘normal’ diffusion
and steam enhancement. In models A & B only the
releasés due to steam enhanced grain growth are
calculated using equation 8. In order to compare the
models, the fractional release by diffusion in
stoichiometric UO, (i.e. using equation 20 with the
unmodified ANS 5.4 diffusion coefficient) was also
calculated and superimposed on the oxidation-induced
release for models A & B.

Figure 5 shows the predictions of each model at
constant temperature for a hold time of 200 seconds.
Model C predicts more release than both A and B at
temperatures above about 1500° C. Below this
temperature, the predicted releases are approximately the
same for all three models. Above 1800° C, Model C
predicts 100 % release of fission products after 200
seconds. Models B & C releases reach 100 % at higher
temperatures.

Figure 6 show the variation of releases with time
at 1400° C over one hour (3600 seconds). The predicted
releases are low (< 10%) forall models until about 900
seconds after the start of oxidation. For the first 900
seconds, Model B predicts higher releases than the other
two models (e.g. -7% for Model B vs ~5% for the other
twoatt=420 seconds). Afterwards, Model C predictions
are higher and Models A and B predict slower rates of
release than model C. After one hour at 1400° C, Model
C predicts slightly less than double the fractional release
calculated using Model B.Figure7 shows the releases for
isothermal oxidation at 1800° C over 1 hour. Model Cpredicts 100 % release within roughly 6 minutes.
Calculations using Model B also result in 100 % release,
but only after about 14 minutes.

Model C predicts a release rate which is
increasing with time over the time period shown in figure
6. This is to be expected because the deviation from
stoichiometry of the fuel is increasing (see figure 3) and
it is still far from reaching its equilibrium composition.
Moreover, the fractional releases are low, therefore there
remains an abundant supply of fission gas available for
release. The two other models predict decreasing rates of
release. The curves in figure 2 show that the grain growth
rate slows down with time and this is reflected in the
fractional release rate which is also decreasing with time
(e.g figures 6 & 7).

6. Conclusions

Two very different approaches to modelling
fission product releases from UO} fuel which is exposed
to steam were compared. One approach relates the
observed increase in releases to enhanced grain growth
and the other to enhanced diffusion of gas atoms and
bubbles through the grain. Two different models which
are based on the first approach were used (Models A and
B), along with one which was based on the second
approach (Model C).

The comparison revealed some similarities in
the trends predicted by the three models, particularly in
the short term. At low temperatures and for short periods
of time, the models predict roughly the same fractional
release.

At relatively high temperatures, model C
predicts faster release of fission products than the other
two. Over long periods of time the accumulated releases
calculated using model C are also greater, even at low
temperatures.

L Introduction —

In some postulated accident scenarios, fuel
element failure can result in exposure of the UO) fuel
pellets to steam for a significant period of time. Fuel
which is exposed to steam can chemically react with it to
form a higher oxide (i.e. UO2, where x is the deviation
from stoichiometry). Oxidation can. cause enhanced
fission product release from the fuel In safety analysis,
estimates of the quantity and timing of fission preduct
releases from failed fuel elements are required in order to
ultimately assess the potential impact of the accident on
the public. Hence it is important to develop our
understanding of the releases of fission products under
steam oxidizing conditions.

grain boundaries, from where they may be released, Gas
atom movement may be controlled by either thermal (e.g.
diffusion) or athermal (e.g. due to irradiation) processes.

Fission products are assumed to be transported
from UO) fuel grains to the grain boundaries by diffusion
and by grain growth accompanied by
sweeping/coliecting of fission products as the grain
boundary moves [1].

An important mechanism governing the release
of fission products at high temperatures is the ‘intrinsic’
(or classical) diffusion of gas atoms to grain boundaries,
followed by the growth of channels leading to open

. surfaces. However, at low temperatures, the observed

releases cannot be explained by an extrapolation of the
classical diffusion theory. Therefore, the releases at low
temperatures are assumed to occur via irradiation
enhanced athermal diffusion [2]. Furthermore, defects
and vacancies within the UO2 can influence the mobility
of gas atoms. For example, it is argued that as it moves
through the lattice, a fission gas atom has a probability of
capture and of escape from internal trapping sites (e.g.
point defects, fission gas bubbles) [3}. The effects of
these mechanisms are generally combined in an
empirical ‘effective’ diffusion coefficient [2,3].

Grain boundary sweeping occurs when bubbles
containing fission gas and the grain boundaries on which
they are located migrate due to grain growth, sweeping
gas from the grains [4]. The “swept” gas is collected.on
the grain boundary where it is available for subsequent
release to void. ,

An increase in the fuel oxygen to uranium (O/U)
ratio leads to a direct enhancement of the release of
fission products from the fuel matrix. In this paper,
differert models which have been constructed to account
for the effect of oxidation on fission product release are
described and compared. The models are divided into two
categories. The first category is comprised of two
methods which model the enhanced release in steam asbasher/aboud

resulting from an increase in the grain growth rate
accompanied by prain boundary sweeping. The second is
a simplified version of a recent model due to Lewis et al
[5] which assumes that the releases result from an
increase in the concentration of vacancies in oxidized
UO2+x. The resulting enhancement of the diffusion
coefficient is then used to estimate the releases.

2. Oxidation

There is a substantial amount of literature
covering the subject of steam oxidation of UO2. The
understanding of important processes involved in the
oxidation reaction and in the observed enhanced release
of fission products has evolved. considerably over the
years.

In 1968, Bittel et al [6] reported that steam
oxidation was controlled by diffusion of oxygen through
the UO, matrix, as opposed to being controlled by the
reaction at the surface of the fuel. Bittel etal also reported
accelerated grain growth for UO2 exposed to steam.

However, in 1970, Carter and Lay [7]
investigated the subject of the rate-limiting process for
oxidation in a CO2/CO atmosphere. They concluded,
based on the absence of a measurable oxygen gradient in
their samples, that oxidation is controlled by the reaction
at the solid/gas interface. No concentration gradient
means that oxygen diffusion within the specimen is faster
than oxygen transfer across the exposed surface.
Therefore, the degree of oxidation is limited by the
reaction at the interface. -

Carter also found that oxidation rates were
proportional to the ratio of surface area/volume and to the
COz+CO partial pressure in a CO)+COtinert gas
atmosphere. An expression for the oxidation rate was
developed based on these results:
dx/dt = a [xe — x()] (S/V) qd)
where:

a is the surface exchange coefficient of oxygen,
X- is the equilibrium deviation from stoichiometry,
x(t) is the deviation from stoichiometry at time t,
S/V is the surface to volume ratio.

Assuming that the fuel is initially
stoichiometric (x(0) = 0), then the solution of the above
differential equation is:

x() =x, [ 1] —exp CaSyV) J (2)

The equilibrium deviation from stoichiometry
is defined by the oxygen potential of the gas phase. The

iderra

Papersiox:
199t/June/10

oxygen potenual in tum is a function of the oxygen partial
pressure in the steam. A method for determining x, is
described in reference [5]. x. may be interpreted as the
thermodynamic limit of fuel oxidation during exposure Lo
steam [8].

The surface exchange coefficient has been
determined experimentally by Cox et al [9] in the
temperature range 1000-1600° C. Comparison with data
from previous experiments suggest that the expression
can be extrapolated to both higher and lower
temperatures. The surface exchangecoefficient, a, can be
calculated from the following correlation:

a = 36.5 exp (-23500/T) (cm/sec) @)
where T is the temperature in K.

Cox and others have also reported that UO2
oxidation in steam leads to an increase in the rate of grain
growth compared to that observed in an_ inert
environment [6,9,10]. It is argued that the activation
energy of grain growth is influenced by the e presence of
excess oxygen [1].

3. Enhanced Grain Growth Model

The phenomenon of enhanced grain growth in
steam has been used to model the enhancement of fission
product releases when UOz is exposed to steam [e.g.
1,11].

Two models of grain growth are described in
this paper. Both are modifications of the same equation
for grain growth in an inert atmosphere. The equation is
based on in-reactor and laboratory measurements of
grain size in UO2 samples [1]:

d25 — do?5 = 2.22x10° At exp(—39200/T) (4)

where
d= final grain diameter (j1m)
do = initial grain diameter (1m)
T = temperature (K)
At = time interval (seconds)

The first model (Model A) is from a paper by
Lau and Rance [1] and is based on the experiments of
Belle and Lustman [10]. The modified grain growth
equation is:

d*5 — do@5 = 1.99 At exp(-10070/T)
for T < 1800° C (5)

d2-5 — do25 = 2.22x108 At exp(-39200/T)
for T > 1800°C (6)The second model (Model B) is based on the
same experimental data as Model A, but follows a more
conservative approach. Belle and Lustman [10] reported
that the resultant grain size obtained by heating UO? at
1700° C in inert aumosphere is the same as that obtained
by heating in steam at 1400° C for identical heating
period. Thus, the model assumes that grain growth in
steam obeys the same rate law as in inert gas except that
the temperature dependence is conservatively shifted by
400 degrees. For this model, the grain growth is derived
from the following equation:

d25 — dp?-5 = 2.22x10° At exp(-39200/(T+400)) (7)

The two grain growth models are compared in
figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows the parameter
(d*5—dg?)/At versus inverse temperature for both
models as well as for grain growth in an inert
environment. The grain size predicted with Model B is
greater than that predicted with Model A over the range
of temperatures displayed (1400 to 2400° C). Figure 2
shows the grain growth over 1 hour at 2400° C and at
1800° C. Model B predicts faster grain growth than
Model A. -

For both models, grain boundary sweeping is
assumed to be responsible for the increased fractional
release. In calculating the fission product release due to
grain boundary sweeping, it is assumed that the grain
boundaries are satmrated. Therefore any fission gas
amriving on the grain boundary is assumed to be
immediately released. This assumption is generally good
for high burnup fuel [1]. It is further assumed that grain
growth is equiaxed as opposed to columnar. Both growth
processes are known to occur, however equiaxed growth
dominates when temperatures are lower than about 2100°
C and large temperature gradients are not present in the

UO,

By making these assumptions, a simple
expression for the fraction of fission gas released as a
function of the increase in grain size is obtained:

f = 1—do3/(dy + Ad)? (8)

where:
Ad is the increase in grain size due to equiaxed grain
growth (jum).

4, Enhanced Vacancy Production Model

basher/aboud

. When uranium dioxide becomes oxidized, the
excess Oxygen is incorporated within the existing lattice
as interstitials, resultifg in a reduction in the number of

oxygen vacancies. There is a corresponding increase in

papersioxide/ra
1991/June/10

the number of uranium vacancies. Lidiard {12] gives an
equation to estimate the fraction of uranium vacancies as
a function of the deviation from stoichiometric
composition (x in UO2,,x). Lidiard’s equation is used to
model the enhancement of the diffusion coefficient due
to oxidation.

4.1 Diffusion Coefficient

In order to account for the excess of uranium
vacancies in the calculation of fission product releases, it
is necessary to model the influence of these vacancies on
the diffusion of atoms through the grains.

A recent interpretation of fission product
diffusion mechanisms by Killeen and Turnbull [2]
separates the diffusion process into three components,
each of which is dominant in a different temperature
regime:

i. intrinsic diffusion at high temperatures (Dj),

_ ii. irradiation enhanced vacancy production at

intermediate temperatures (Dj;) and,

iii, irradiation enhanced athermal diffusion at low
temperatures (Djii).

whereS = exp (-147200/RT) (16)
Fo = exp(-71300/RT) (17)

The model proposed by Lewis et al [5] uses the
diffusion coefficient described above to modify the
empirical one in the ANS 5.4 [13] model employed in
CANDU fuel codes such as ELESIM [14]. Thus the ANS
5.4 diffusion coefficient is multiplied by a correction
factor H(x) to account for deviation from stoichiometry.

If Ds.4is the diffusion coefficient in the ANS 5.4
model, then

D’5.4=Ds.4- H(x) (18)
where
H(x) = D(x,T) / D(x=0,T) (19)

The fractional releases are calculated using the
Booth model [15] which gives the cumulative release
from the grains f:

f=6-(D’s,4 t/ra2)¥/2 — 3 D’s.4 t/a? (20)

where
D’s.4= modified diffusion coefficient (m2/sec)
t= time (sec)
a= grain radius (m)

This method of calculating the fission product
release is a simplification of the model described in
reference 5, where the enhanced diffusion coefficient was
incorporated into the ELESIM fuel code.

As in models A and B, it is assumed that the
grain boundaries are saturated, and that any fission gas
arriving on the grain boundary is immediately released.

42 Deviation from Stoichiometry

In order to use this model, it is necessary to
estimate the deviation from stoichiometry of the uranium
dioxide which is exposed to steam (x in UO»,,). The
method used is the one reported in section 2. The results
are shown in figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows the variation

~ of the degree of oxidation with time for various

‘

ashertaboud

temperatures. The oxidation rate is much more rapid as
the temperature increases. Figure 4 shows the correction
factor (H(x) calculated using equation 19) as a function

‘«» O£x for temperatures ranging from 700 to 2200° C. Little

enhancement is predicted at low temperatures (700 to
1000° C) unless the fuel reaches a state of oxidation
around UO z;. However at higher temperatures, the
correction factor can-be 1000 or greater. The factor is
highest around 1400°C.

5. Comparison =

A comparison of the fission product releases
predicted by each model is shown in figures 5, 6 and 7.
The models are designated as follows:

Model A: Enhanced grain growth model suggested by
Lau & Rance (see section 3)

Model B: Enhanced grain growth modelled by 400°
temperature shift (see section 3)

Model C: Enhanced vacancy production model
suggested by Lewis et al (see section 4)

In all the simulations, the initial grain size (‘do’
in equations 4-8; ‘2a’ in equation 20) was chosen to be
7.5 yum. The UQ) surface to volume ratio, which is used
in the calculation of the deviation from stoichiometry
(equations 1 and 2) was determined assuming a stack with
diameter 1.2 cm. and length SO cm. (roughly the
dimensions of the fuel within a CANDU fuel element).
The resulting value for S/V is 3.37 cml.

The releases plotted in figures 5, 6 and 7 were
calculated differently for Models A & B than for Model
C. Total releases predicted by model C are calculated with
equation 20 using the enhanced diffusion coefficient
(equation 18) which accounts for both ‘normal’ diffusion
and steam enhancement. In models A & B only the
releasés due to steam enhanced grain growth are
calculated using equation 8. In order to compare the
models, the fractional release by diffusion in
stoichiometric UO, (i.e. using equation 20 with the
unmodified ANS 5.4 diffusion coefficient) was also
calculated and superimposed on the oxidation-induced
release for models A & B.

Figure 5 shows the predictions of each model at
constant temperature for a hold time of 200 seconds.
Model C predicts more release than both A and B at
temperatures above about 1500° C. Below this
temperature, the predicted releases are approximately the
same for all three models. Above 1800° C, Model C
predicts 100 % release of fission products after 200
seconds. Models B & C releases reach 100 % at higher
temperatures.

Figure 6 show the variation of releases with time
at 1400° C over one hour (3600 seconds). The predicted
releases are low (< 10%) forall models until about 900
seconds after the start of oxidation. For the first 900
seconds, Model B predicts higher releases than the other
two models (e.g. -7% for Model B vs ~5% for the other
twoatt=420 seconds). Afterwards, Model C predictions
are higher and Models A and B predict slower rates of
release than model C. After one hour at 1400° C, Model
C predicts slightly less than double the fractional release
calculated using Model B.Figure7 shows the releases for
isothermal oxidation at 1800° C over 1 hour. Model Cpredicts 100 % release within roughly 6 minutes.
Calculations using Model B also result in 100 % release,
but only after about 14 minutes.

Model C predicts a release rate which is
increasing with time over the time period shown in figure
6. This is to be expected because the deviation from
stoichiometry of the fuel is increasing (see figure 3) and
it is still far from reaching its equilibrium composition.
Moreover, the fractional releases are low, therefore there
remains an abundant supply of fission gas available for
release. The two other models predict decreasing rates of
release. The curves in figure 2 show that the grain growth
rate slows down with time and this is reflected in the
fractional release rate which is also decreasing with time
(e.g figures 6 & 7).

6. Conclusions

Two very different approaches to modelling
fission product releases from UO} fuel which is exposed
to steam were compared. One approach relates the
observed increase in releases to enhanced grain growth
and the other to enhanced diffusion of gas atoms and
bubbles through the grain. Two different models which
are based on the first approach were used (Models A and
B), along with one which was based on the second
approach (Model C).

The comparison revealed some similarities in
the trends predicted by the three models, particularly in
the short term. At low temperatures and for short periods
of time, the models predict roughly the same fractional
release.

At relatively high temperatures, model C
predicts faster release of fission products than the other
two. Over long periods of time the accumulated releases
calculated using model C are also greater, even at low
temperatures.
